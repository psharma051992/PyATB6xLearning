# A Program example forloop Reverse

for i in range(10, 0, -2):  # Here reverse output will be printed starting from 10 to 2
    print(i)                # as negative index is possible in this case


# num = range(10)   # It will print output range : # range(0, 10) as it is function itself
# print(num)
