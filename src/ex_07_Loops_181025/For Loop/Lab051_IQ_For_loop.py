# Another Program based on interview question

for i in range (1,10):    # here by default step is 1 (which means increment with 1)
    print(i)

# for i in range (10):   # here by default start is 0. So,it will the value from 0 to 9.
#    print(i)           # Rest the logic is same

# for i in range(-1, -10, -1):  # This will also works
#    print(i)

# for i in range (1, 10, -1): # In this case, nothing will print out and no output as increasing with -1
#     print(i)                # as simplifying it : 1 - 1 = 0
