# Another Example of Ternary Operator

user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# if user_age >= 18:
#    print("Yes, You can Goa and Vote")
# else:
#    print("No, You can't Goa for Voting")

# now, we can convert above if else block into  liner

print("Yes, You can Goa and Vote" if user_age >= 18 else "No, You can't Goa for Voting")
